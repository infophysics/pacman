Notes on installation of Vivado.

1) Installed lastest version of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

This is technically not supported, and Vivado will complain, but it seems unreasonable to insist on an out-of-date version from 16.04 branch.  


2) Download and install the webpack for the whole vitas suite:

Set /tools/ to a user owned directory, so installed there as normal user.

After installation, used "perl ldd-recursive.pl ..." as described at:
   https://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/66184.html
   to determine the missing libraries:

libtcmalloc.so.4 => not found
libboost_signals.so => not found
librdi_common.so => not found
librdi_commonmain.so => not found

Satisfied the first two with:

$ sudo apt-get install google-perftools
$ sudo apt-get install llibboost-signals-dev

The last two are Xilinx libraries, and are already located in Xilinx
installation lib directory.  To see this, you can set LD_LIBRARY_LOAD to include the Xilinx libraries, but this isn't really needed.  Evidently, Vivado already finds these libraries.


3) Because I installed as root, the cable drivers were not installed automatically, so I had to do the following:

- unplug all cables (including SoMs with FTDI driver over USB, effectively a JTAG cable)

$cd /tools/Xilinx/Vivado/2018.3/data/xicom/cable_drivers/lin64/install_script/install_drivers/

$sudo ./install_drivers
